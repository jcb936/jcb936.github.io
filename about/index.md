Hey there! I'm **Jacob** (*he/they*), a game developer based in London (UK) and originally from Rome (Italy).

I'm a *BSc Discrete Mathematics* graduate from the *University of Warwick* and an *MSc Computer Games Technology* graduate from *City, University of London*.

I am working full-time as an engine programmer for [Larian](https://larian.com/). I also previously worked as unreal engine programmer for [ZA/UM](https://zaumstudio.com/) and as systems programmer for [Splash Damage](https://www.splashdamage.com/) on [Transformers: Reactivate](https://www.playtfr.com/). This is the lil corner of the internet where I will collect my personal projects and occasionally write some blog posts on a variety of topics. 

I also go by *renard* on the web, you (if you speak Italian) might know me for the Italian translations of UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE, [more info here]({{ site.url }}/undertale-spaghetti-project). 

Apart from games, I spend my spare time doing photography and experimenting with mixed media. I also love playing Magic: The Gathering and bouldering.

You can reach me via e-mail at [jacob.arbib@gmail.com](mailto:jacob.arbib@gmail.com) and you can find a (hopefully) up-to-date CV by clicking the download link below. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you want info about any obscure project I have done in the past that is not posted here.
