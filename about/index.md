Hey there! I'm **Jacob Arbib** (*he/him*), a game developer based in London (UK) and originally from Rome (Italy).
     
I am currently working full-time as a systems programmer at [Splash Damage](https://www.splashdamage.com/) on [Transformers: Reactivate](https://www.playtfr.com/). This is the lil corner of the internet where I will collect my personal projects and occasionally write some blog posts on a variety of topics. 

I also go by *renard* on the web, you (if you speak Italian) might know me for the Italian translations of UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE, [more info here]({{ site.url }}/undertale-spaghetti-project). 

In my spare time I like to experiment with photography and mixed media; while I still need to properly curate and collect my photos, you can see *some* of them on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/renard936/).

Finally, you can reach me via e-mail at [jacob.arbib@gmail.com](mailto:jacob.arbib@gmail.com) and you can find an (hopefully) up-to-date CV by clicking the download link below. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or you want some info on any obscure projects I have done in the past that is not posted here.
