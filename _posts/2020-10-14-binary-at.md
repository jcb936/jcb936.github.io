**CW: Transphobia**

In the past couple of years, I got closer and closer to the LGBTQI+ community through a process of self-discovery. While discovering different online queer creators, I was shocked by the sheer amount of hateful comments towards trans and non-binary folks. **Binary@** is a fake test that will categorise you in one of two binary groups, red or blue, metaphorically representing female and male respectively. In Binary@ there is no room for nuance or a spectrum, you are either red or blue. If you try to balance the two out and escape the conventional norms you are met with a black screen and the end of the game, showing a random hateful comment about trans and non-binary people from various online sources.
