## about
     
During my [**MSc in Computer Games Technology at City, University of London**](https://www.city.ac.uk/prospective-students/courses/postgraduate/computer-games-technology), I had the occasion of playing around with a variety of different technologies, and had the occasion to produce multiple projects as coursework. These include, but are not limited to:

* A simple bullet-hell shooter in MonoGame
* A Unity rhythm game prototype including a pitch and a game design document
* Two simple 3D games made in OpenGL/C++ from first principles

I will eventually curate and catalogue them all, but in the meantime you can see some (**non curated**) source code and other stuff by clicking the below buttons. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you want more info regarding any of the work I did during my course. On top of these projects, I've also produced a confidential thesis on ECS and data cache coherency, done in collaboration between City and Splash Damage.
