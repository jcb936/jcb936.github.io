**Into the Sun Maze** is a little game I made as a test to get an internship in Amsterdam at DTT. It is a simple game where the objective is to get to the end of each room before the sun becomes too bright and consumes you. You can reduce the sun intensity by getting the collectibles along the way. You can also change view and zoom-in to the character to slow down the sun's ascent. Each room is a randomly generated maze using Prim's algorithm. This was one of my very first projects in Unity and many things I would do differently nowadays. I would like to go back and expand the concept with my new knowledge eventually.

The built game is not currently accessible but the source is available on GitHub by clicking the button below.
