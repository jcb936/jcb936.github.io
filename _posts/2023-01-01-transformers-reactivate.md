During my time at Splash Damage, I worked as systems programmer on **Transformers: Reactivate**, a 1-4 player online action game. Below is some of my work on the game:

* Responsible for consoles ports development and optimisation
* Developed low level custom UE systems and gameplay systems (e.g. input system, event-based hierarchal FSMs)
* Implemented gameplay features in the context of a co-op mulitplayer online action game
* Performance analysis and optimisation with PIX and Unreal Insights
* Custom engine systems manteinance and integrations
