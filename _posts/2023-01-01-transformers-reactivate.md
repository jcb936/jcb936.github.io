## about
     
I am very proud to be currently working as a systems programmer for Splash Damage on **Transformers: Reactivate**, a 1-4 player online action game. Below is a list of some of my work on it:

* Responsible for consoles ports development and optimisation
* Developed low level custom UE systems and gameplay systems (e.g. input system, event-based hierarchal FSMs)
* Performance analysis and optimisation with PIX and Unreal Insights
* Custom engine systems manteinance and integrations

A closed beta for the game is planned in 2023. Stay tuned for more info! Click the buttons below to go to the official website and see the announce trailer.
