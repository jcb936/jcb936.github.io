From 2015 to 2021, I have lead a project for the Italian translation of Toby Fox's games UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE. **Undertale Spaghetti Project** is a passionate group of programmers, designers, translators and artists all working non-profit to make these games accessible to people who don't speak English. We developed in-house tools to reverse engineer the games code to access the original script and inject code and translated sprites, developed a workflow for translators and proofreaders and cultivated the biggest Italian community for the games on Facebook. 

A case study was conducted on us by Laura Previtali (MA Audiovisual Translation); *Fan Translation of Video Games â€“ A Case Study: The Spaghetti Project*, L. Previtali, Dr. M. A. Bernal-Merino, Roehampton University, 2018. She would later join the team as a translator and proofreader.

The patches have been released, the project is not under active manteinance at the moment.
